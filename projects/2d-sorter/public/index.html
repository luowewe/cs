        Place items along the horizontal axis based on how well you think using AI
        tools for that task supports learning and along the vertical axis based on
        your opinion of how useful current AI tools are for the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you might place something far to the right on the horizontal
        axis because it <i>could</i> be a great learning tool but low on the
        vertical axis because AI tools aren't good at it yet or vice versa, high
        on the vertical axis because AI tools are great for doing the task but on
        the left side of the horizontal axis because students will learn more by
        doing the task without AI assistance.
