In this assignment you will add code to scripts/script.js which is loaded by the
HTML page dynamic.html in order to make dynamic.html contain the same HTML as
index.html but generated via Javascript code that manipulates the DOM.

You'll probably need to look at index.html in the editor to see exactly what
HTML elements it's using but you can also look at it in the browser to copy and
paste text that you need.

You don't need to make any changes to styles/style.css; it's just there to make
the pages look okay.
